CustomToolBarButton
===================

Style your app with custom toolbar buttons. Using this sample project and Helper class you'll be able to create custom buttons. 

You can see a bigger difference with a button "highlight" that feels more like a physical button.

Use Helper.h to style a button after you set an IBOutlet from your UI to your code. It'll preserver any IBAction that you've set.
